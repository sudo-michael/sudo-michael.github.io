I'm a 4th year PhD candidate at Simon Fraser University under the supervision of
[Dr. Mo Chen](https://sfumars.com/mo-chen/) and [Dr. Sharan Vaswani](https://vaswanis.github.io/).

I'm broadly interested in Safe Reinforcement Learning and Reinforcement Learning Theory. In particular, I'm interested in how Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability analysis can be combined with Deep Reinforcement Learning methods and the convergence rates of (stochastic) policy graident methods for (C)MDPs.
